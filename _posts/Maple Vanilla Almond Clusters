INGREDIENTS
1 cup whole almonds
⅓ cup chopped pecans
1 tbs. butter
1 tsp. vanilla extract
1 tsp. maple syrup
1 tbs. water
¼ cup sugar

1: Toast nuts in a nonstick skillet over medium heat, stirring occasionally (about 5 minutes)., 2: Add water, vanilla, and maple syrup to sugar and stir to combine., 3: Add sugar mixture and butter to toasted nuts. Continue to heat over medium, stirring constantly, until the mixture is sticky and no longer runny (about 3 minutes)., 4: Remove from heat and spread the nuts around in the pan. Let sit for a few minutes in the pan, give another stir and spread the nuts again. Sprinkle with a few shakes of table salt or pinches of sea salt if you like sweet/salty nuts (highly recommended by me)! Let sit for at least 1 hour in the pan or until cool and hardened (the flavor develops as they cool – so make sure you don’t eat them all right away). Break into chunks and enjoy!
