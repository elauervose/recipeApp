### About the Recipe App
This is a fun practice project for learning JavaScript that also happens to be something entierly funtional that I have wished for frequently.  This app is intended to help me collect, organize, and access all my favorite recipes which are spread across, books, dropbox folders, phone apps, bookmark links, and random scribbles on scraps of paper attached to my fridge.

#### The Plan:
Future iterations if this project will include React 



### This is a Jekyl Project
